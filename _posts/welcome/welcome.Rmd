There are two views about factories that are very
widespread.

1.     
One is that factories are huge messes that cannot
possibly be understood, and at the best that anyone can do is to overbuild them
and then, react to unwelcome events as they happen.

2.     
The other is that factories can be understood, but only
designed and operated using common sense, non-quantitative methods.

1.     
The message here is that we can treat factories with
quantitative engineering approaches and methods.

2.     
Complex systems can be
hard to manage. And when a system is not well-understood, rules for management
proliferate. This is because rules are developed to regulate behavior. Behavior
refers to how the system behaves and how it reacts to events. Good rules
promote desirable behavior. Bad rules promote bad behavior. But bad rules can
lead to unexpected, undesirable behavior. Why? Because the system is not
well-understood. If you don't understand how a system works, you won't design
rules that lead to desirable behavior and desirable performance. Once somebody
sees that things aren't going so well, they develop new rules to regulate the
new behavior. But these new rules won't be so good for the same reason. You
don't understand the system. You see the bad behavior, and you develop still
more rules, and so forth. Whenever you see a complicated system in which there
are large, large numbers of rules, that may be a sign that the system is not
well-understood, and you have to go back to basics to really understand it.
